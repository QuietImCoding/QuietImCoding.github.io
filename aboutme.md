I don't really like putting personal information on the internet but rougly speaking:

- I'm a college student
- I love computers and am studying Computer Security
- I've always wanted a blog
- I've never known what the heck to blog about
- While I study security (and love it), most of the weird stuff I want to talk about is unrelated to computers
- I'm mining cryptocurrency on your computer as you read this
